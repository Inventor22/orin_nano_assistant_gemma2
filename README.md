# Gemma 2 on Jetson Orin Nano - Google Dev Day Tokyo Demos

If you have a Jetson Orin Nano and want to use Gemma 2, my talk at the Google Gemma 2 Dev Day in Tokyo explains everything from scratch to running any of these codes step by step in a very simple way. Hereâ€™s the video where I explain it all:

## Demos

1. **Home Assistant Demo**  
   This demo showcases a basic home assistant powered by Gemma 2, using Whisper for speech-to-text, FAISS for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Piper for text-to-speech. Gemma 2 runs on port 8080 using `llama.cpp` to process the input and generate responses.

   - Key components:  
     - Whisper: Transcribes voice input into text.
     - FAISS: Uses RAG to find relevant context from a set of predefined documents.
     - Gemma 2: Runs on port 8080, responsible for generating concise and relevant answers based on the input.
     - Piper: Converts the generated text into speech.
   - How it works:  
     When the system detects voice input (indicated by beeps due to the lack of silence detection), it uses Whisper to transcribe the text. FAISS enhances this input with external context, and Gemma 2, running on port 8080 via `llama.cpp`, processes the input and provides a concise response. Finally, Piper converts this response into speech.

2. **Translation Assistant Demo**  
   This demo implements a translation assistant that listens to English input, translates it into Japanese, and speaks the translation using Coqui TTS. Gemma 2 also powers this translation process, running on port 8080.

   - Key components:  
     - Whisper: Transcribes English voice input.
     - Gemma 2: Translates the input from English to Japanese, running on port 8080 with `llama.cpp`.
     - Coqui TTS: Synthesizes the translated Japanese text into speech.
   - How it works:  
     After receiving and transcribing voice input via Whisper, Gemma 2 translates the text using the model running on port 8080. The translated text is then synthesized into spoken Japanese using Coqui TTS.

3. **Multi-Agent System Demo**  
   This demo demonstrates a multi-agent setup where two instances of Gemma 2 communicate with each other using different personalities. One instance of Gemma 2 runs on port 8080 and the other on port 8082. Both models, powered by `llama.cpp`, simulate a conversation between two distinct personalities: one creative and one analytical.

   - Key components:  
     - Gemma 2: Two instances of the model running on ports 8080 and 8082, respectively.
     - FAISS: Optionally used for memory and enhanced context handling.
   - How it works:  
     Two separate instances of Gemma 2 are launched on different ports, with one being more creative and the other more analytical. These instances engage in a simulated conversation, showcasing the multi-agent capabilities of Gemma 2 running on an edge device.

## Execution

The code is very straightforward to run. It's essentially a Python script with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

1. Install the dependencies with:
   ^^^bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ^^^

2. Here's what each script does:
   - `home_assistant.py`: Runs a basic voice-activated assistant using Whisper for speech-to-text, FAISS for context retrieval, and Gemma 2 (on port 8080) for response generation, with Piper for text-to-speech.
   - `translate.py`: Implements a voice-to-voice translation system from English to Japanese using Whisper for transcription, Gemma 2 (on port 8080) for translation, and Coqui TTS for speech synthesis.
   - `multi_agent.py`: Runs two instances of Gemma 2 (on ports 8080 and 8082) as a multi-agent system, simulating a conversation between two different personalities.

### Assets

There is an `assets` folder containing two `.wav` files (beeps) that signal when you can start and stop speaking. These beeps are used because the home assistant does not implement silence detection. The purpose of this code is to show how a minimal home assistant can be built with just a few lines of code.
